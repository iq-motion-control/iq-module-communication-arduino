# Arduino API

This is the library to control a IQ Motion Control Module with an Arduino

## Getting Started

You can download the latest stable release of this library on the arduino IDE [library manager](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries). Just look up "IQ Module Communication".  Read the programming [documentation](http://www.iq-control.com/documentation) on our website to learn how to use this library.  
A .zip of the library can also be found on our [release page](https://github.com/iq-motion-control/iq-module-communication-arduino/releases). Follow these [instructions](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries#toc4) to install a library manually.  
Read the programming [documentation](http://www.iq-control.com/documentation) on our website to learn how to use this library.  

### Prerequisites

You will need an arduino with serial ports and the arduino [IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).  
This library might work on other boards that is supported by the IDE but we have not tested them.
